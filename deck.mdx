# Put the func back in your testing

<Notes>

- I want to talk about functional programming and how it can help us make testing more enjoyable
- Maybe I am weird but there is a rush or something about writing a suite of tests that makes you feel confident in the code you just wrote
- So this talk is for those of you who may be struggling with your test suites and for those of you that aren't triggered by the words "functional programming"

### For those of you <strong>triggered</strong> by the words <em>Functional programming</em>

<Notes>

Please rest assured that I am not here to convert you using mind control. I am not
here to tell you to write your code only in this way. Zealotry around which tools we use hurt
us developers. At the end of the day it is about tradeoffs what "negatives" are we willing to accept
in light of the positives.

</Notes>

---

## So, what is my <em>intent</em>?

<Notes>

- To give you a tool in your tool-belt, so when the time arises you can evaluate the trade-offs of choosing one tool over the other.

# Testing is <em>hard</em>...

Math.random();

const arbitraryDate = new Date();
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

So you may be saying to yourself, why is this a problem? And to be honest it's 
not really that problematic. There are ways to mock these constructst out.
The real problem is that it adds a layer of complexity on top of your test code
that could be avoided. It makes it harder for the developer following in your footsteps
to get to the meat of the test to find out what is important.

```js title="MODIFYING PARAMETERS"
function makeThingFly(obj) {
    obj.canFly = true;

    return obj;
};
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

This leads to code needing to be called in the correct order to produce the desired result

Resulting in bugs as code is refactored

</Notes>

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES"
function putBirdOnIt(obj) {
    if(obj.notPretty) {
        obj.hasBirdOnIt = true;
        obj.notPretty = false;
    }

    obj.bird.attack();

    return obj;
};

```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

Again, not something that is bad or wrong. This could be a completely reasonable
implementation. However, when it comes to testing there are not more test cases to consider.
More setup required which again obfuscates the important part of the tests.

</Notes>

## Learning the <em>"right"</em> way is hard

<Notes>

This is a blessing and a curse of a dynamic language like JavaScript. There
are many ways to accomplish our daily tasks and everyone has their own opinion on how
to accomplish it. This is one reason why we see click baity blog titles.

In my experience there are two main sources to get a foundation so that you can start
working with tools/frameworks/languages.

1. Blogs/Docs
2. Examining existing code

<Step subtitle="THE IDEAL CASE">

```js
// in add.js
function add(n1, n2) {
    return n1 + n2;
}

export default add;
```

```js
import add from './add';

describe('add', () => {
    test('adding 1 and 2 should equal 3', () => {
        expect(add(1,2)).toBe(3);
    });
});
```
</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

<Notes>

- Stop me if you have "heard" this one before
- Examples are over simplified
- Don't match real world
- Real world there is state and external dependencies

#### Standing on the Shoulders of <em>giants</em>

<Appear>

## Or copying and pasting other tests

</Appear>

<Notes>

- This solves for the real world part of the problem
- But you are missing context around the choices the previous developer made
- Why assert on X and not Y or not X and Y
- Why is this data important in the setup?
- This path still leaves some gaps

# What is <em>Functional Programming</em>?

<Notes>

Who has tried to learn FP? Who stuck with it?

Why? From my own attepmts at learning it, it is overwhelming. So much math and honestly WTF is a functor?

My hope is that as we work through this you'll see that the concepts aren't so bad and you'll see that you are actually using
the majority of them already.

A programming paradigm using pure functions as the atomic unit of 
composition, avoiding shared mutable state and side-effects. It is declarative rather than imperative.


</Notes>

---

# <em>Why</em> should you care?

- Concise
- Predictable
- Easier to test

# <strong>Pure</strong> Function

<Notes>

A pure function is one that, given the same input will produce the same output and does note modify any global state.

# Shared <strong>mutable</strong> state

<Notes>

Any variable or object, or property of that object, that exisits in a shared scope

The problem with shared state is that you must understand its history when making changes. Meaning, if someone changes some code upstream
it can affect code downstream in an non-obvious way.

</Notes>

```js title="jQuery"
$(function() {

    $('#special-button').css('background-color', 'red')
    $('#not-so-special-button').on('click', function() {
        $('button').css('background-color', 'grey')
    })
})
```

- DOM/CSS is one giant global object
- Makes debugging hard
- Makes testing hard
- Thoughts on why React is so popular?

# Side Effects

<Notes>

Side effects is essentially any code that is interacting with the outside world.

How do you handle side effects in redux?

# Composition

<Notes>

- Building a pipeline for data to flow through
- You are probably doing this already

# Imperative vs <em>Declarative</em>

Writing the code in a way that makes the steps to get there very prescriptive vs here is my desired end state

- What happens when we want to get a list of flying Canadian superheros
- Or just flying superheros
- Our filtering logic is becoming more and more critical and harder to understand with no real tests around it
- Let's see how we can leverage some of ideas we learned earlier to make this cleaner

</Notes>

### Principle 1:
## Don't <em>change</em> anything you don't own

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js file="./src/snippets/example-mutation.js"
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Principle 2:
## Describe <em>what</em> not how

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js file="./src/snippets/example-declarative.js"
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Principle 3:
## Do <strong>one</strong> thing and do it well

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js 1:19 file="./src/snippets/example-one-thing.js"
```

```js 22:30 file="./src/snippets/example-one-thing.js"

## Let's review

---

## Functional programming is <strong>not scary</strong> because:

<ol>
    <Appear>
        <li>I was already most likely using some of its core concepts</li>
        <li>Helps me to write code that is easier to understand</li>
        <li>...and debug</li>
        <li>Tests become simpler and more robust</li>
        <li>Increases my confidence in the code I have written</li>
    </Appear>
</ol>

---

## This happens when our code follows some principles:

<ol>
    <Appear>
        <li>Don't change anything you don't own </li>
        <li>Describe what not how</li>
        <li>Do one thing and do it well</li>
    </Appear>
</ol>
