  - QA Guild - Guild Master
- Testing is hard and Functional programming is scary
- What this talk is NOT
  - I am not a functional programming zealot
  - This is a tool for your toolbox
- Why is testing hard?
  - "Thing" under test has several concerns
  - Have several code paths to test
  - Side effects
  - Dependent on state shape
  - These things problems because they add complexity to the test suite
- Code example
- Functional Programming is scary
  - MATH!!!
  - Jargon
  - Did I mention math?
- What is Functional programming
  - It is a programming paradigm
  - Applications are composed using pure functions
  - avoiding shared mutable state and side effects
- What do these things get us?
- Review some terminology w/ code examples
  - compose
  - pure function
  - shared mutable state
  - side effects
- 3 Guidelines to make your code more functional
  - Describe "what" not "how"
  - Code example showing a refactor incremental improvement
  - Functions don't lie
    - composable
    - referential transparency
  - Code example showing a refactor incremental improvment
  - Focus on one thing
  - Code example showing a refactor incremental improvement
  - Final refactor
  - Review benefits
